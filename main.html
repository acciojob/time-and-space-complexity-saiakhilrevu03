	 <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm as a function of the length of the input. It helps in determining how efficient an algorithm is, especially when dealing with large data sets.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. It is typically expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n), to describe how the space requirements grow as the input size increases.
